      <h2>Our Goal</h2>
      <h3>Growing Real Food</h3>
      <p>We believe good food should nourish both body and community. Our mission is to grow fresh, high-quality culinary mushrooms right here in Lakewood, CO, and share them with people who value healthy food, sustainability, and connection.</p>

      <h2>Why Mushrooms?</h2>
      <p>Mushrooms are nutrient-rich, versatile, and packed with flavor. They're full of vitamins, minerals, and plant-based protein and they can be grown sustainably year-round. Plus, they taste amazing!</p>

      <h2>Our CSA Vision</h2>
      <p>Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) connects farmers and neighbors directly. You purchase a share of our harvest, and every week or two we provide fresh mushrooms from our farm to your table.</p>
      <h3>Building Real Community</h3>
      <p>33% of people in the Denver metro area face food insecurity. We seek to help alleviate this need by regularly providing discounted shares to our members and donations to local food charity organizations. </p>
      <p>Based on their own financial needs our CSA members can sign up for 3 different levels of CSA subscriptions.</p>
      <ul>
        <h2 class="subscription-header">Subscription Levels</h2>
        <li><b>Sustaining</b> - Pay our suggested membership rate that will help us cover all our business costs.</li>
        <li><b>Pay what you can (PWYC)</b> - Pay an amount below the sustaining level that works for your family's financial needs.</li>
        <li><b>Pay it forward</b> - Pay an amount above the sustaining level in order to help us grow as a business, provide for our PWYC members and other outside food charities.</li>
      </ul>
